Software lets you turn your ideas into products. 
  
- At Dropbase **(YC W20)**, I worked on a product with 25000+ installs and scaled it to support 25X concurrent usage
- At Unyte Health, my first job, I had to debug obscure SQL bugs on launch day while our team lead was away

I had the opportunity to be an executive at clubs that received **$8000** grants and were recognized as Ontario's Best High School Newspaper by the Toronto Star. As much as I enjoyed social work - holding doors at 8AM in the morning, wheeling a cart of food waste to school because my landlords wouldn't let us compost - creating large scale value requires more than intention.
