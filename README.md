### 🚀 I'm on a journey to redefine my potential

In Grade 7, I failed my math exam.

In Grade 11, I got an A in AP Calculus.

I'm only getting started.

### 🛠 I'm here to make things.
- [Earbug](https://github.com/taziksh/earbug-frontend), a tool to discover that song stuck in your head
- [Hayasaka.AI](https://github.com/taziksh/hayasaka.ai), an experiment with using AI to create art
- Recette, Sign2Voice, and other prototypes at [MLH Hackathons](https://devpost.com/ZKTKZ?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav)

### 🌱 I want to create real value.

<details><summary>I'm new to STEM. I spent high school making prose, memes, and sticky notes. </summary>
<p>

I had the opportunity to be an executive at clubs that received **$8000** grants and were recognized as Ontario's Best High School Newspaper by the Toronto Star. As much as I enjoyed social work - holding doors at 8AM in the morning, wheeling a cart of food waste to school because my landlords wouldn't let us compost - creating large scale value requires more than intention.

<details><summary>That's why I enrolled in UWaterloo Engineering Co-op. </summary>
<p>

- At Dropbase **(YC W20)**, I worked on a product with 25000+ installs and scaled it to support 25X concurrent usage
- At Unyte Health, my first job, I had to debug obscure SQL bugs on launch day while our team lead was away
