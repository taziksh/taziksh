I'm Tazik. 

In Grade 7, I failed my math exam.
In Grade 11, I got an A in AP Calculus, after skipping Grade 12 math and taking Grade 10 and 11 math in the same year with high 90's.

**I'm on a journey to redefine my potential. **

## I'm here to make things.
- [Earbug](https://github.com/taziksh/earbug-frontend), a tool to discover that song stuck in your head
- [Hayasaka.AI](https://github.com/taziksh/hayasaka.ai), an experiment with using AI to create art
- Recette, Sign2Voice, and other prototypes at [MLH Hackathons](https://devpost.com/ZKTKZ?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav)
- I'm learning to use Procreate - stay tuned for my ~~toons~~ comics

## I want to create real value.

I'm new to STEM. I spent high school making prose, memes, and sticky notes. I had the opportunity to be an executive at clubs that received **$8000** grants and Toronto Star's Best High School Newspaper Award.  I enjoyed social work - holding doors at 8AM in the morning, wheeling a cart of food waste to school because my landlords wouldn't let us compost. 

But creating value at scale requires more than intention. You need to be a maker.
That's why I enrolled in UWaterloo Engineering Co-op, even thought I was a humanities kid.

I'm a sophomore now, and I've gained valuable experience working as a software engineer on web apps, databases, and security. 
- At Dropbase **(YC W20)**, I worked on a product with 25000+ installs and scaled it to support 25X concurrent usage
- At Unyte Health, my first job, I had to debug obscure SQL bugs on launch day while our team lead was away 

My current focus is on growing as a frontend developer and designer (React, CSS, and Figma). I have many ideas I want to share, and design is the bridge to their implementation. 

## Epilogue
This is just the beginning. If I am an exponential function, we're far from the steep end.

If you want to collaborate on a cool project, or just chat, email me at mailto:tazikshahjahan@pm.me. My https://calendly.com/taziksh/coffee is also open to cold coffee chats.

I'll be writing many more words of `code` and *prose* in the coming months. If you'd like occasional updates on my work, you can sign up for my newsletter at...

I'm currently seeking **Winter 2022 co-op** positions, trying to pass Engineering school, and working on Earbug's Product Hunt launch. If you would like to be a part of my journey and help support my creative independence, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tazik).
